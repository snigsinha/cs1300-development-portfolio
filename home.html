        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          For my UI/UX class at Brown, I was tasked to create a ReactJS Web App for an E-commerce 
          of my imagination. The goal of the task was to create a page such that it would:
          <ul>
            <li>Display items for purchase</li>
            <li>Filter on two properties (e.g. size, color)</li>
            <li>Sort on one property (e.g. price)</li>
            <li>Add and remove items to Cart</li>
            <li>Display total price for items in the Cart</li>
            </ul> 
          
            I decided to make the web-page with a focus on usablilty. 
            Visually I used buttons with a traditional button look that changed colour on hover.
            This makes it easy for the user to see what actions are avaible to them. <br>
            In terms of information heirarchy, I kept the sorting and filtering actions at the top 
            so the user sees the actions clearly. I also kept the cart and items for selction side by side
            so that the user browses through items with the reminded intention to add to cart.

          <p>
          Through this task, I got a lot of value from learning about how the React DOM works 
          as well as using state and JSX Components. I look forward to using in a more involved
          way in the future.
